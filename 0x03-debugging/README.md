Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors in software that prevents it from running correctly.

This directory contains task files on debugging as stated below:

0-main.c, main.h
Based on the given main.c file, create a file named 0-main.c. This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0. You only need to upload 0-main.c and main.h for this task

1-main.c 
Copy this given main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

2-largest_number.c, main.h
Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.

3-print_remaining_days.c, main.h
Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
